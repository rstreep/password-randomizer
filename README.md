# password-randomizer

## Description

My goal with this challenge was to deploy a site that provides users a way to create a random password based on criteria of their choosing. Upon clicking the generate password button users are greeted with a prompt that asks how long they want their password to be and which characters to include in it. After selecting all of the criteria the user is met with a randomly generated password.
